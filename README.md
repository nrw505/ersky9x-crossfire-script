# ersky9x-crossfire-script
This project aims to add support for configuring TBS CROSSFIRE devices on ErSky9x Radio TX firmware via BASIC-scripts.

ErSky9x supports full-speed CRSF telemetry on 9XR-Pro, 9Xtreme and other boards, but there's no support for lua scripting a'la opentx due to the limited memory of older processors they use.
